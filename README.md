👩‍💻 About Me
I'm passionate about building intelligent automation and scalable web solutions. My skill set bridges front-end technologies (React, Vue.js) with robust backend systems (Node.js, Python), and I have extensive experience with the ServiceNow platform, including ITSM, Flow Designer, and REST integrations.

With a keen interest in AI/ML, I've integrated deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) into workflows to create adaptive, efficient systems. I strive to develop software that solves real problems—clean, smart, and user-centered.
